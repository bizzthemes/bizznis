== External plugin integrations ==

This folder contains files that allow Bizznis to integrate with popular external plugins and scripts.
Even though Bizznis is built up to each end every WordPress standard and recommendation,
some high profile plugins use their own way of manipulating WordPress templating
system and functions. We made an extra effort to integrate all popular plugins,
so you don't even need to think about it, when you activate them.
